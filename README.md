***Visit my App: https://binged-entertainment.herokuapp.com/***


Binged Entertainment was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, Handlebars, Express, Mongodb, Mongoose, BootStrap and Express-Session.

This app was designed in order to keep track of the movies a user watched. If a friend ever asks "Hey, what do you think about this movie?" you will be able to open this app and tell them exactly when you watched it, what you would rate it, and a brief comment of how you felt right after watching it.

### Stretch Goals

* Allow for users to be able to add books as well. 
* State the way you watch/read this title. For example for movies and shows (Netflix, Hulu, AMC Theatre, Drive-In). For books (Hardback, Digital, etc)
* Add API that shows a picture, description and trailer/blurb of the movie or book.
* Add the number of times watched/read.
* List of networks and apps you can currently get access to the item you read/watched.
* Filter by network. For example, if Netflix is toggled, then only Netflix movies and shows that have been watched should populate.

### Blockers

For this project my thought process was to go big or go home. I really wanted to push myself in this project so I took on a lot of challenges that would rapidly expand my knowledge about programming. Alot of the experiences I went through for this project was done for the first time. This was my first time using Handlebars, BootStrap, Express, MongoDB and Sessions, as well as all of the features and bugs that come with them. The biggest blocker that I experienced was using sessions for my user authentication. I faced a constant barrage of bugs and issues while trying to authenticate this application. 

Another blocker was time. Due to the fact that a lot of the languages and frameworks I used in this project were done for the first time, I didn't know how to properly account for bugs, time management and studying/implementation. To add to this, I also decided to try using an API for the first time in order to provide users with the images of their selected movies, but for the reasons mentioned above I was not able to successfully add this feature to my project.

### What I Learned

This project taught me alot about time management as well as understanding when to switch things up and adopt a different approach to an issue that is showing itself to be persistent and perhaps detrimental to the success of the project. After completing this project, I later learned that the biggest issue that I faced (which was authentication) could have been accomplished in a multitude of ways that would have been just as beneficial to my project. Instead, I continued to waste time and energy on implementing sessions even though it was not working. Had I taken a step back and tried learning about, then implementing other authentication methods such as JWT, or firebase, I would have most likely gotten my authentication to work in a lot less time, and I would have been able to focus more time and energy on improving MVP's or beginning new stretch goals.
